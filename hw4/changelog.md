For the website changes (markup, style, content): 
    
    Updating some aspects of my website, I decided to include more and better content.
    I decided to write better descriptions and include more information for my work experiences, 
    and I also was more descriptive about each of the CS Projects listed. 

    For my art projects, I included two more photos with descriptions on the 
    art_projects.html page. I have also created a new webpage called art_gallery.html that hosts
    just the photos and titles of some of my art. It is intended to eventually hold all of my hosted art 
    on the site. Animations have been added on most pages. FAQs page is still a work in progress. 

    I also slightly updated my 404 page. 

For the third party libraries: 

    I downloaded fullPage.js and Anime.js, and the rest are pulled externally. 

    Google Analytics: Tracks user and traffic activity
    link: 

        I included the script tags in the head element of each page in order 
        to better track all activity across my site. This should help me better 
        understand how to improve my site with data.

    fullPage.js: Create full page websites/sections spanning the whole viewport easily
    link: https://alvarotrigo.com/fullPage/
        
        I utilized this in order to create my art-gallery page at art_gallery.html, whereupon
        one can scroll through pictures one at a time and appreciate each in its own individuality. 
        I included the link to the gallery on the main art_projects.html page.

    Animate on Scroll: add effects easily upon scrolling through the page
    link: https://github.com/michalsnik/aos

        I included this script of the bottom of the pages (as per the docs), 
        and utilized it in order to simplify allowing elements and sections to
        fade in upon being visible in the viewport. It is simple, but could be 
        better optimized, to be honest. 

    Anime: create and automate animations for html elements
    link: https://animejs.com/

        I used anime to simply animate the menu buttons doing a 360 degrees rotation upon
        the initital page load on every webpage.
